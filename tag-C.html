    <h2>University milestones</h2>

    The moment my programming skills really began to evolve was during university. I was learning a lot, mainly because we often spent Saturdays and Sundays there, developing concepts together. The first year started with simple projects, such as recreating standard C library functions like printf and strlen.<br />
    <br />
    At that point, I wasn’t very confident with Linux systems yet, but I had already developed the (in)famous Racedriver title in C++. This gave me a slight edge, and the tasks weren’t as challenging for me as they were for some of my peers.<br />
    <br />
    The first significant project we tackled was math-based. The objective was to calculate the angle of a ball hitting a paddle in a Pong game. There was even a bonus point for developing a complete Pong game—and of course, I went all in. I ended up putting way too much effort into making that game, simply because I loved making games. It thrilled me that game development was now part of my academic journey.

<p class="post-content">
    A few weeks later, we faced a new challenge: creating a project inspired by a legendary id Software game, Wolfenstein 3D. Aptly named wolf3d, the project required us to implement ray tracing to project walls onto a grid map. I was stunned—this was how developers in the early days created 3D games with minimal resources and basic renderers. In just a few lines of code, I had the foundation of a Doom-like experience. That project shifted my perspective on game creation and opened the door to the world of graphics programming.<br />
    <br />
    Although I didn’t delve deeply into raw graphics after that and eventually transitioned to game engines, learning those fundamentals was amazing.
    <br />
    The journey continued with projects that explored the inner workings of systems. One standout was coding a Bash-like shell from scratch in C++. Through this, I discovered the intricacies of file descriptors, output/input piping, and shell behavior. It was a thrilling experience and one that later motivated me to start my StbxEngine project.<br />
    <br />
    Another fascinating project was called CoreWar. It was a battle between two programs, each attempting to overwrite the other’s memory. The concept was—and still is—widely popular online, with communities continually developing AI for it.<br />
    <br />
    I’m sure I’ve forgotten some projects, but these are the ones that left a lasting impression on me. They were milestones in shaping my understanding of programming and igniting my passion for creating.<br />
