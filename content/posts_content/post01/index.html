    Next year, I will turn 30. It feels like a big milestone. A turning point that has me reflecting on how I’ve spent my time.
    Looking back, one constant thread through my life has been the countless hours spent in front of a computer.<br />
    It’s not just about the time; it’s about what that time gave me.<br />
    <br />
    From the moment I first tinkered with a program or scribbled ideas for a new project, the computer became more than a tool—it was my creative canvas.
    Over the years, I’ve poured my curiosity, passion, and countless late nights into projects of all kinds.
    Some were small experiments, others grew into something I was truly proud of. All of them, though, were stepping stones that shaped my journey.<br />
    Now, as I reach this milestone, I feel compelled to look back at those projects, starting from the very first one.<br /><br />
    By sharing these projects, I’m creating a record for myself—a future reminder of where I began and how far I’ve come.
    And maybe, just maybe, it will inspire someone else to look back at their own journey or start one of their own.<br />
    <br />
    Let’s dig into the archives and rediscover the magic of creating.
