    <h2>University milestones</h2>
    <h4 class="post-date">08/12/2024 •  story  project  C  C++ </h4>
    <div><p class="post-content">
    The moment my programming skills really began to evolve was during university. I was learning a lot, mainly because we often spent Saturdays and Sundays there, developing concepts together. The first year started with simple projects, such as recreating standard C library functions like printf and strlen.<br />
    <br />
    At that point, I wasn’t very confident with Linux systems yet, but I had already developed the (in)famous Racedriver title in C++. This gave me a slight edge, and the tasks weren’t as challenging for me as they were for some of my peers.<br />
    <br />
    The first significant project we tackled was math-based. The objective was to calculate the angle of a ball hitting a paddle in a Pong game. There was even a bonus point for developing a complete Pong game—and of course, I went all in. I ended up putting way too much effort into making that game, simply because I loved making games. It thrilled me that game development was now part of my academic journey.

    </div>
<p class="post-content">
    A few weeks later, we faced a new challenge: creating a project inspired by a legendary id Software game, Wolfenstein 3D. Aptly named wolf3d, the project required us to implement ray tracing to project walls onto a grid map. I was stunned—this was how developers in the early days created 3D games with minimal resources and basic renderers. In just a few lines of code, I had the foundation of a Doom-like experience. That project shifted my perspective on game creation and opened the door to the world of graphics programming.<br />
    <br />
    Although I didn’t delve deeply into raw graphics after that and eventually transitioned to game engines, learning those fundamentals was amazing.
    <br />
    The journey continued with projects that explored the inner workings of systems. One standout was coding a Bash-like shell from scratch in C++. Through this, I discovered the intricacies of file descriptors, output/input piping, and shell behavior. It was a thrilling experience and one that later motivated me to start my StbxEngine project.<br />
    <br />
    Another fascinating project was called CoreWar. It was a battle between two programs, each attempting to overwrite the other’s memory. The concept was—and still is—widely popular online, with communities continually developing AI for it.<br />
    <br />
    I’m sure I’ve forgotten some projects, but these are the ones that left a lasting impression on me. They were milestones in shaping my understanding of programming and igniting my passion for creating.<br />

    <h2>Learning programming as a teenager... with C++ and cyphering</h2>
    <h4 class="post-date">07/12/2024 •  story  project  C++ </h4>
    <div><p class="post-content">
    It’s been a wild ride since the days when declaring a variable and assigning it felt like an insurmountable challenge.
    Let’s throw it back to the very first day I learned programming.<br />
    <br />
    I was in high school, the year 2011, and we had quite a lot of free time. While most kids spent their breaks playing outside, my friends and I chose a different path—we gathered in the school library to teach ourselves programming.
    They decided to start with Java. At that age, with zero knowledge of any programming language, I couldn’t bring myself to be interested in it.
    Instead, I began experimenting with something simpler: creating interactive prompts using the Windows Batch scripting language.<br/>
    <br />

    <p>A good example of a very bad UI</p>

<p class="post-content">
    After tinkering around for a while, I realized it was time to challenge myself further.
    Around the same time, my friends had finished their metaphorical cup of coffee (finally),
    and we all agreed to focus on a new deity of programming: C++.
    We turned to a well-known French website called "Site du Zéro" created by Matthieu Nebra.
    It was brilliantly written and provided a thorough introduction to C++ programming fundamentals.<br/>
    <br />
    I still remember summarizing the course on A5 cardboard notes, with 4-colour penballs.
    Remarkably, I still have those notes in my office drawer to this day, like a “lucky charm” of sorts!<br/>
</p>

    <p>If only I was this dedicated at school at that time!</p>
</div>
<p>
    Armed with our newfound knowledge, my friends and I set out to write our very first program: a substitution cipher utility.
    Looking back, it was hilariously bad, but it worked!
    <br />
    The project was a simple "choice menu" that, believe it or not, was incredibly inconvenient to use because it required a ridiculous number of inputs just to encrypt a file.
    It used multiple encryption methods, all based on substitution.<br />
    <br/>
    One method swapped all the ASCII alphanumeric and special characters with integer values, which were written as 3-character sequences (yes, the output was three times bigger. I definitely wasn’t planning on encrypting my entire drive back then).
    Other methods just replaced characters with random garbage symbols.<br />
    The real problem with the code, despite all the attention I paid in the C++ course, was that any complexity was handled using switch cases: one for each character supported by the method.<br />
    It was... not pretty. Just plain bad code. But, for the record, I’m oddly proud of it. I still have a copy tucked away in a private repository, mostly for the sake of nostalgia (and a bit of embarrassment).<br />
