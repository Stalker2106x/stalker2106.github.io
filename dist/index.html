    <h2>The day I decided to create this space</h2>

    <div><p class="post-content">
    Next year, I will turn 30. It feels like a big milestone. A turning point that has me reflecting on how I’ve spent my time.
    Looking back, one constant thread through my life has been the countless hours spent in front of a computer.<br />
    It’s not just about the time; it’s about what that time gave me.<br />
    <br />
    From the moment I first tinkered with a program or scribbled ideas for a new project, the computer became more than a tool—it was my creative canvas.
    Over the years, I’ve poured my curiosity, passion, and countless late nights into projects of all kinds.
    Some were small experiments, others grew into something I was truly proud of. All of them, though, were stepping stones that shaped my journey.<br />
    Now, as I reach this milestone, I feel compelled to look back at those projects, starting from the very first one.<br /><br />
    By sharing these projects, I’m creating a record for myself—a future reminder of where I began and how far I’ve come.
    And maybe, just maybe, it will inspire someone else to look back at their own journey or start one of their own.<br />
    <br />
    Let’s dig into the archives and rediscover the magic of creating.

    <h2>Learning programming as a teenager... with C++ and cyphering</h2>
    <h4 class="post-date">07/12/2024</h4>
    <div><p class="post-content">
    It’s been a wild ride since the days when declaring a variable and assigning it felt like an insurmountable challenge.
    Let’s throw it back to the very first day I learned programming.<br />
    <br />
    I was in high school, the year 2011, and we had quite a lot of free time. While most kids spent their breaks playing outside, my friends and I chose a different path—we gathered in the school library to teach ourselves programming.
    They decided to start with Java. At that age, with zero knowledge of any programming language, I couldn’t bring myself to be interested in it.
    Instead, I began experimenting with something simpler: creating interactive prompts using the Windows Batch scripting language.<br/>
    <br />

    <p>A good example of a very bad UI</p>
</div>
<p class="post-content">
    After tinkering around for a while, I realized it was time to challenge myself further.
    Around the same time, my friends had finished their metaphorical cup of coffee (finally),
    and we all agreed to focus on a new deity of programming: C++.
    We turned to a well-known French website called "Site du Zéro" created by Matthieu Nebra.
    It was brilliantly written and provided a thorough introduction to C++ programming fundamentals.<br/>
    <br />
    I still remember summarizing the course on A5 cardboard notes, with 4-colour penballs.
    Remarkably, I still have those notes in my office drawer to this day, like a “lucky charm” of sorts!<br/>

    <p>If only I was this dedicated at school at that time!</p>
</div>
<p>
    Armed with our newfound knowledge, my friends and I set out to write our very first program: a substitution cipher utility.
    Looking back, it was hilariously bad, but it worked!
    <br />
    The project was a simple "choice menu" that, believe it or not, was incredibly inconvenient to use because it required a ridiculous number of inputs just to encrypt a file.
    It used multiple encryption methods, all based on substitution.<br />
    <br/>
    One method swapped all the ASCII alphanumeric and special characters with integer values, which were written as 3-character sequences (yes, the output was three times bigger. I definitely wasn’t planning on encrypting my entire drive back then).
    Other methods just replaced characters with random garbage symbols.<br />
    The real problem with the code, despite all the attention I paid in the C++ course, was that any complexity was handled using switch cases: one for each character supported by the method.<br />
    It was... not pretty. Just plain bad code. But, for the record, I’m oddly proud of it. I still have a copy tucked away in a private repository, mostly for the sake of nostalgia (and a bit of embarrassment).<br />
